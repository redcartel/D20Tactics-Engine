# D20Tactics-Engine

Spent about 6 months in 2021 on this. It's the engine for an unfinished Final Fantasy Tactics-esque RPG that intended to be based off of the OGL D20 rules.

Most notable features are an embedded JavaScript console & mod system. Line-of-sight tile reveal, and an implementation of A* in the JavaScript mod code.
